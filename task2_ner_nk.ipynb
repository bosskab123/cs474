North Korea appears to be advancing its submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) program, with indications a second testing platform is being readied for deployment, a U.S. website showed Friday.38 North, which specializes in North Korea analysis, said commercial satellite imagery from Nov. 11, 16 and 24 show the country\\'s second platform for launching missiles underwater outside of submarines has been moved.\\xa0Captured satellite image from 38 North (Yonhap)The platform, known as a submersible ballistic missile test stand barge, \"is being prepared to enter service, a strong indicator that Pyongyang is advancing its SLBM program,\" the website said, citing analysis by expert Joseph S. Bermudez Jr.On Nov. 11, the barge was seen positioned on a construction way at the Nampo Navy Shipyard, with a floating dry-dock at the end of the construction way. Five days later the barge was seen aboard the floating dry-dock and towed a short distance to an adjacent pier.By Nov. 24, the test stand barge had been floated off and positioned near the shipyard\\'s fitting-out deck to apparently undergo finishing touches, such as installation of pumps and communications, before deployment.\"The exact nature of the fitting-out work that will be undertaken on the test stand barge is unclear, as is the date when it will be completed and can be placed into service,\" the analysis said. \"Once in service, this barge will help facilitate a broader SLBM testing regime and potentially establish a SLBM capability within the West Sea Fleet.\"North Korea acquired its first submersible ballistic missile test stand barge in 2014, according to the website. It is based at the Sinpo South Shipyard and supports the development of thePukguksong-1 SLBM and the SINPO-Class experimental ballistic missile submarine. (Yonhap)',\n",
       " 'New activity seen at test stand of N. Korea\\'s SLBM development site: 38 North. Recent satellite imagery indicates new activity at the test stand of North Korea\\'s main submarine-launched ballistic missile development shipyard in a move that suggests the communist nation is planning to accelerate its SLBM program, a website monitoring the North said Thursday.The April 29 imagery of the Sinpo South Shipyard shows a heavy-lift crane with its stabilizer legs deployed and boom extended out over the test stand\\'s service tower, and a 13-meter-long flatbed truck adjacent to it on the access road, 38 North said.The test stand was used during 2014-2016 for launch systems verification, and pop-up and prototype testing of the Pukguksong-1 (KN-11) submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), it said. (Yonhap)It is difficult to determine from the imagery alone whether the activity is related to maintenance, removal of the service tower or preparations for an upcoming test, 38 North said. The new activity comes after the February test launch of a Pukguksong-2, which is the land-based version of the Pukguksong-1 SLBM and two tests of the KN-17 medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) on April 5 and 16, 38 North said.In conjunction with these developments, the recent activity at the Sinpo test stand likely has a number of implications for the future of the SLBM program and suggests that North Korea is planning to accelerate the program or develop new designs to complement its land-based ballistic missiles,\" it said.

       " \"N. Korea developing larger-class submarine for missile launch: expert. North Korea is developing a larger-class submarine as the country moves to further develop submarine-launched ballistic missile capability by 2020, a US military expert said Wednesday.North Korea is building a new bigger class of submarine than the existing Sinpo-class, and the new project seems to have been kicked off several years ago, Joseph Bermudez, co-founder and chief analytic officer of AllSource Analysis, said at a briefing organized by 38 North.His assessment is in line with outlooks from other North Korean observers who speculated that Pyongyang is seeking a bigger sub that can enhance its SLBM capability. The Sinpos are relatively small subs with a displacement of around 2,000 tons. They are known to have vertical ballistic missile launch tubes built into the sail of the submarine.On Wednesday, North Korea launched an SLBM from the East Sea, the country's third SLBM test-fire this year.The missile flew some 500 kilometers before landing in waters within Japan's air defense identification zone, demonstrating an improvement from its previous launch tests. Bermudez said the latest missile appears to have been fired underwater from a submarine, rather than from a submersible test barge, which he said may have been the case for the North's SLBM test last December. North Korea is displaying a strong will to build an operational SLBM system under a long-term plan and steady progress has been made, he said.If North Korea achieved that goal, it would complicate ballistic missile defense planning and operations being sought by South Korea and the US, he also warned. Assuming the current rate of development, North Korea is on track to develop the capability to strike targets in the region, including Japan, from a missile fired from a submarine by 2020, he noted. Citing 38 North's satellite imagery taken on Monday near a submarine base near the eastern port city of Sinpo, the analyst said North Korea seems to have made preparations for the Wednesday SLBM launch that day. The satellite image showed a large construction crane placed close to a submarine moored along a submarine dock.\\xa0 (Yonhap)\",\n",

Recent satellite imagery shows North Korea is forging ahead with development of a submarine-launched ballistic missile, the website 38 North said Tuesday.The imagery taken of the North\\'s Shinpo Shipyard on April 29, six days after the North\\'s latest SLBM test, shows that a submersible missile test stand barge has been moved from its normal position.\"This shift in location suggests that the SLBM program may be moving towards a more advanced stage of development where the need for a submersible test stand barge has diminished,\" 38 North said.\"That conclusion appears to be reinforced by recent test launches from the submarine itself rather than the barge.\" It described the North\\'s SLBM test as \"successful.\"\"While North Korea\\'s submarine-launched ballistic missile program is making progress, these activities appear in line with previous estimates that the first ballistic missile submarine and operational missiles are unlikely to become operational before 2020,\" it said.\\xa0(Yonhap)',\n",
       " 'N. Korea aims to build new 3,000-ton sub armed with 3 SLBMs: experts. North Korea may be in the process of developing a 3,000-ton submarine that can provide a stable platform to launch three submarine-launched ballistic missiles as the country is scurrying to enhance its nuclear delivery capability, military experts here said Monday.Local military observers said to meet such a goal, Pyongyang may move to test-fire SLBMs until it is confident in launching a missile that can fly as far as 2,000 kilometers, the experts also predicted.On Saturday, North Korea fired a SLBM from a 2,000-ton Sinpo-class submarine in the East Sea in its latest SLBM test-firing after the country first publicized it carried out a SLBM ejection test in May 2015.\\xa0After soaring from the water, the ballistic missile flew some 30 kilometers.Although the flight distance fell far short of a regular SLBM that could fly several thousand kilometers, South Korean experts assessed that the North has made progress in advancing its technology from the initial ejection test stage to the flight test phase.With the recent progress, North Korea may have already embarked on a project to build a larger submarine that could carry a number of SLBMs, an armament substantial enough to pose tangible threats to the United States, according to the experts.\\xa0North Korea\\'s current 2,000-ton submarine can embark and launch one SLBM from about 10 to 15 meters below the water\\'s surface. This shallow depth puts the submarine at greater risk of detection compared with bigger SLBM-equipped submarines that could go down some 50 meters, the experts said.\\xa0They also stressed that the communist country would continue to make efforts to increase its SLBM range to the extent that their submarine missiles could pose threats to the United States from very far away.\\xa0\"If the missile flew 30 kilometers in the initial flight test, it means progress has been made to some extent,\" one expert well versed on submarines said.

       " 'N.K. apparently fired ballistic missile from submarine: S. Korean military. North Korea launched what appeared to be a ballistic missile from a submarine in the East Sea Saturday, the South Korean military said. (Yonhap)The Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korea fired a projectile that it believes was a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) around 6:30 p.m. The JCS said it is keeping close tabs on the North Korean military while maintaining its readiness posture.The JCS didn\\'t immediately say if the launch was a success.According to a South Korean government source, the SLBM\\'s engine ignited after it was ejected from a 2,000-ton Sinpo-class submarine, but the missile only traveled a short distance.\"This projectile, which is believed to be an SLBM, was airborne for a couple of minutes,\" the source added.Last month, a U.S. news report claimed that North Korea had conducted a ground test of an SLBM, the KN-11. The Washington Free Beacon said the test on March 16 involved an ejection test of theKN-11 from a canister at Sinpo shipyard on the North\\'s eastern coast.Neither the Pentagon nor the State Department confirmed the report\\'s veracity.In May last year, Pyongyang claimed it had successfully carried out an underwater SLBM test, followed by what officials said were unsuccessful tests on Nov. 28 and Dec. 21. Its Sinpo-class submarine was reportedly damaged during the botched Nov. 28 test, and the repair work was completed earlier this month.Then on March 26, a North Korean propaganda website uploaded a video clip showing an SLBM striking Washington.If confirmed, the latest SLBM test would add to the series of provocative steps Pyongyang has taken in recent months in defiance of international sanctions.North Korea faced sanctions after its fourth nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch the following month. The country appears to be preparing for another nuclear detonation at its Punggye-ri test site.The North\\'s SLBM capability, if fully developed, would pose a serious threat because of its mobile nature. Experts say that an \"ejection\" test is usually conducted in the early stages of developing SLBM capabilities, and Pyongyang is believed to still be many years away from developing an SLBM.

       " 'N. Korea continues SLBM development: 38 North. North Korea appears to be continuing efforts to develop a submarine-launched ballistic missile, a U.S. website monitoring the communist nation said Thursday.The website 38 North said, citing recent satellite imagery of the North\\'s Shinpo South Shipyard, that the North is believed to be forging ahead with development of the KN-11 SLBM, also known as Bukkeukseong-1, as well as a Gorae-class experimental ballistic missile submarine. It said that about two months of unidentified work on the Gorae-class submarine appears to have been completed now. A removable tower used to support a rocket engine has also remained at the test stand for the past two months, allowing the North to more quickly conduct a pop-up test, it said.\"Despite legitimate concerns about North Korea\\'s development of a SLBM and a ballistic missile submarine having a significant effect upon regional security, these developments represent an emerging rather than a current threat,\" 38 North said. \"Deployment of such operational systems will be an expensive, time-consuming endeavor for North Korea and there is no guarantee of success. Regardless, these programs require continual monitoring to ensure appropriate responses are in place if or when they reach fruition,\" it said. (Yonhap)',\n",
       " 'N. Korea believed to have conducted latest SLBM test from barge, not submarine. North Korea is believed to have conducted its latest submarine-launched ballistic missile test from a submerged barge, not from a submarine, a U.S. expert said Tuesday, a finding that suggests the North is still many years away from mastering SLBM capabilities.The December test is the North\\'s third known SLBM test following the first in May and the second in November. Unlike the failed November test, the latest test was once reported as successful. But South Korea later said the North is believed to have manipulated the video of the launch.\"While parts of the video footage of the launch are believed to have been faked, examining the initial stages of this launch, along with satellite imagery of the submarine and support vessels in port two days later, suggests that this test was probably conducted from a submerged barge rather than an actual submarine,\" John Schilling, a rocket expert, said in a report carried by 38 North.\"With only three known tests reported to date and no successful launches from a submarine, North Korea has a long way to go to develop this system. Initial operational capability of a North Korean ballistic-missile submarine is not expected before 2020,\" he said.The expert said that the North\\'s video shows what appeared to be a support vessel standing about 50-100 meters from the missile launch site, which he said would be dangerously close to a submarine operating at shallow depth for a missile launch.But it would be \"just right, and quite necessary, for a submerged barge,\" he said.One of the most pressing issues after an SLBM test is to remove or replace the launch canister, which requires a crane, Schilling said. Commercial satellite imagery taken of the North\\'s Sinpo Shipyard just two days after the test shows a crane next to the submersible test barge, not the submarine, he said.In May, North Korea claimed it successfully carried out an SLBM test underwater, renewing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The North\\'s SLBM capability, if fully developed, would pose a serious threat because its mobile nature would make it very difficult to detect preparations for a launch.But experts said it was believed not to be a full-scale test, but an \"ejection\" test conducted in an early stage of developing SLBM capabilities.

The failure damaged the North\\'s first missile submarine, identified by officials as the Gorae, which means whale in Korean, the report said.The report provided no further details, not even if the missile\\'s engine ignited after the ejection or whether the missile took flight.But it quoted an unidentified official as saying that based on the latest successful ejection test, North Korea could be as little as a year away from deploying a submarine armed with a nuclear-tipped missile. However, the South Korean military official played down the North\\'s SLBM capability, arguing that Pyongyang would need more time before deploying SLBMs, although it is continuing relevant tests.The North remains silent about the reports of its SLBM test and the Pentagon refused to confirm it.Meanwhile, the North Korea-monitoring website, 38 North, also said that the reports of last month\\'s SLBM test appear to be true and supported by new commercial satellite imagery of the Sinpo South Shipyard.

       " 'N. Korea\\'s SLBM test conducted from barge, not from submarine: U.S. expert. North Korea is believed to have conducted the recent test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile from a submerged barge, not from a submarine as claimed by the communist nation, a U.S. expert said Tuesday.Joseph Bermudez, a top North Korea military expert, also said the North appears to have \"photoshopped\" images of the test to exaggerate progress in its SLBM development, saying the photo released by Pyongyang shows no flame coming from the missile\\'s engine when a \"bright pink shadow\" was reflected in the water.The assessment, disclosed during a discussion hosted by the website 38 North, suggests that the North has not made as much headway as previously feared in the development of submarine ballistic missiles, even though the regime is making progress.The North claimed Saturday that leader Kim Jong-un oversaw a successful underwater test-launch of a \"strategic submarine ballistic missile.\" The test, if confirmed, would represent a significant step forward in the North\\'s missile technology.\"The North Korean press says it was launched from the submarine. I have some significant doubts whether that\\'s true,\" Bermudez said, citing satellite imagery taken of the North\\'s Shinpo Shipyard a day after the missile test, which shows a submarine docked next to a barge. The North must have tested the missile from the barge, the expert said, speaking via a video link from Colorado, where his AllSource Analysis is based.Noting that the North launched the submarine only in October last year, Bermudez emphasized it is almost impossible for the regime to test an SLBM from the vessel only six to seven months later. Such a submarine-based test is at the\" very, very outside of any possible North Korean technology at the moment,\" he said.\"Typically what you do when you develop and test a ballistic missile that is to be launched from a submarine, you test it first on land, then from barges or submersible containers and then eventually you conduct a test from a submarine,\" he said.\"If you look at the imagery the way North Korea portrays on KCNA, you are given the impression or you\\'re left with the impression that the submarine itself conducted the launch. I have some serious doubts about that at this point in time,\" he said.Bermudez also said that the missile used in the test is believed to be much shorter than the North\\'s Musudan or Nodong missiles, citing the size of what appeared to be a ballistic missile shipping container adjacent to the submarine in the satellite imagery.\"So this would suggest that North Korea\\'s developing a new missile. Some people point at the KN-11. We really don\\'t know at this point,\" he said.The expert also raised suspicions that the North released manipulated photos.\"If you look at some of the imagery that was provided by KCNA, some things don\\'t match up,\" Bermudez said, referring to Pyongyang\\'s official news agency.One of the KCNA photos shows \"a bright pink shadow in the water, reflection in the water, from the missile launch,\" which he said can be expected only if a flame comes from the missile\\'s engine, he said.\"However, in the image, there is no flame visible. There is just smoke and water and steam,\" he said. \"This might suggest that some of the imagery that was provided to the public was photoshopped or manipulated in some fashion to give it a different impression.\"Bermudez also said that the North has repeatedly conducted \"camouflage, concealment and deception operations.\"For now, the North\\'s submarine capabilities are only an \"emerging threat,\" the expert said.\"We\\'re not looking at a dramatic increase in submarine capabilities while we\\'re looking at incremental improvements in submarine capabilities, incremental expansion of submarine force and incremental development of ballistic missiles,\" he said.Joel Wit, head of 38 North, also said the North is years away from developing submarine missile capabilities.\"Even with a very strong, maximum effort, in five years, they might be able to deploy ballistic missile submarines with help from overseas, but those submarines would not pose a threat to the United States, and once again, be more of a regional threat,\" he said.South Korea\\'s defense ministry described the North\\'s missile launch as \"very serious and worrying,\" and urged Pyongyang to cease the development of such missiles, even though officials said the missile appeared to have flown only about 100 or 150 meters from the surface of the water.President Park Geun-hye also called it a \"serious challenge.\"The North\\'s SLBM, if developed, would pose a serious threat because its mobile nature would make it very difficult to detect preparations for a launch. The North\\'s new road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile, KN-08, has also been a serious concern to the U.S. (Yonhap)']"

South Korean President Park Geun-hye returned home Monday after a four-nation Middle East swing meant to further expand economic ties beyond oil and construction.The trip to four Gulf States -- Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar -- came as oil-rich Mideast countries are pushing to diversify their economic portfolios ahead of the inevitable advent of a post-oil era.South Korea believes that such attempts could present new business opportunities for its companies, especially in such fields as health care and information and communications technology.South Korea views the potential business opportunities as the \"second Middle East boom\" following the first one in the 1970s when many Korean workers sent home their hard-earned cash from sweating at construction sites in the region.The Middle Eastern countries \"are offering us another chance with the second Middle East boom,\" Park said Sunday in a meeting with more than 100 South Korean businessmen who accompanied Park on her trip.In Doha, Park and Qatar\\'s emir agreed to further cooperate in nuclear reactors and health care while cementing ties in such traditional sectors as construction, Park\\'s office said.Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani told Park that he is ready to further develop cooperative relations with South Korea in a wide-range of issues, noting South Korea is a model of Qatar\\'s economic growth.Park also sought Al Thani\\'s interest to ensure that South Korean companies can participate in industrial and infrastructure projects in the oil-rich Gulf state, saying that South Korea, which co-hosted the 2002 World Cup with Japan, can be a good partner for Qatar in building infrastructure.Qatar plans to spend about US$100 billion to expand its infrastructure such as roads and stadiums to prepare for the 2022 World Cup. South Korea hopes that its companies can secure some of the projects.Park and Al Thani also observed the signing of a memorandum of understanding calling for cooperation on training nuclear experts and on building a nuclear reactor for medical and other research purposes.South Korea said the MOU could help its companies win projects in case Qatar decides to build nuclear reactors in the future.The move came just days after Park and Saudi Arabia\\'s new monarch observed the signing of an MOU calling for a joint partnership on a nuclear reactor developed by South Korea for export to water-scarce countries, including the Middle East.South Korea said the MOU could help its companies win a US$2 billion project to build two mid-size commercial reactors in Saudi Arabia if the desert kingdom decides to build the reactors after a preliminary review set to end by 2018.In Kuwait, Park held talks with Kuwait\\'s emir, Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, and sought his interest and assistance to ensure that South Korean companies can participate in industrial and infrastructure projects in the oil-rich country.In Abu Dhabi, Park was upbeat over an MOU on cooperation on halal food products as it could give Seoul access to the huge global halal market, which is expected to grow to $1.62 trillion by 2018.Halal is an Arabic word meaning \"lawful\" or \"permitted.\" Halal food is prepared according to religious rules for Muslims, but 80 percent of the food comes from non-Muslim countries and companies, according to South Korea.

       " 'Korea, Qatar to bolster economic partnership. DOHA ― Leaders of South Korea and Qatar agreed to expand cooperation in infrastructure, investment, energy and medical services during a summit on Sunday, an event expected to open business opportunities for Korean firms in the Gulf state, the host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.Park and her Qatari counterpart emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thanion discussed ways to bolster ties in infrastructure projects planned for the international sports event. The oil-rich Gulf state will host the event and plans to spend about $100 billion on construction projects including railroads, expressways, harbors and stadiums.Taking the opportunity of the bilateral summit, South Korean officials said that they expect to participate in $29 billion worth infrastructure projects in the future, including the construction of the main stadium, railway and sewage processing.\\xa0 President Park Geun-hye (third from left) and her Qatari counterpart emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thanion at their summit on Sunday (Yonhap)The two sides also agreed to make joint investments in global markets. Qatar Investment Authority and Korea Investment Corporation have agreed to jointly establish a fund worth $2 billion for this purpose, they said. The Qatari agency also expressed its interest in six projects in Korea, raising the possibility that the Gulf state would start making substantial investments in Asia’s fourth-largest economy. QIA ranks ninth in terms of the asset size. It currently holds about $256 billion worth of assets, according to officials. The meeting between Park and emir Tamim came only four months after the leaders met in November in Seoul.The two leaders observed the signing of a memorandum of understanding on nurturing professionals in the field of nuclear energy and development. The agreement was meant to secure more opportunities for Korean firms if Qatar plans to build nuclear reactors in the future, officials said.Qatar was Park’s final destination of her four-nation trip to the Middle East. She earlier traveled to Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to diversify business relations amid falling oil prices and a slowing Korean economy. Her senior secretaries said the trip helped South Korea diversify its business relation with the Gulf states, and expanded Park’s diplomatic landscape to the region. During her trip, South Korea signed a total of 44 MOUs and her business delegates clinched 1 trillion won ($ 900 million) worth of contracts with their partners in the four countries. An MOU on nuclear reactors reached with Saudi Arabia was the highlight of her trip. Under the agreement, the two sides are set to conduct a joint study to review the feasibility of building Korean-made midsized multifunctional nuclear reactors in the kingdom. If realized, the $2 billion project will help firms secure more opportunities as Saudi plans to build up to 18 large-reactors in the future.

(Yonhap)Park also secured Kuwait’s support for her North Korea policies during the summit. Kuwait is the only Gulf nation in which a North Korean embassy is stationed, with around 4,000 North Koreans being registered as laborers at construction sites. However, Kuwait -- the rotating chair of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a regional economic union of Arab states -- has been urging North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambition.Park arrived in Kuwait on Sunday (local time) for the first leg of her four-nation trip to the Middle East. Her trip is aimed at forging fresh strategic ties in the region amid falling oil prices and South Korea’s slowing economy. Park is the first South Korean president to visit Kuwait in eight years.Prior to her meeting with the emir of Kuwait, Park held separate talks with parliament speaker Marzouq Al-Ghanim and Prime Minister Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah. Her meeting with speaker Al-Ghanim was crucial as the parliament exerts significant influence in state-led construction projects, according to the presidential office. Taking advantage of the summit, the two sides agreed to build a model town in the Gulf nation operated by a smart grid system, one of South Korea’s leading technologies for sustainable energy. The two also agreed to strengthen cooperation in the medical sector by encouraging Kuwaiti patients and doctors to experience the South Korea’s advanced medical technology.Park’s summit with the Kuwaiti leader was expected to offer fresh business opportunities for South Korean firms. They are hoping to take part in $44.3 billion worth of construction projects expected in the world’s sixth-largest oil producer, officials said.The Mideast state, with a population of 4.12 million, plans to build an inner city metro system as well as a nationwide railway connecting to five other Gulf nations.

       " 'Park seeks to upgrade relations in Gulf. President Park Geun-hye’s trip to the Middle East next week is expected to bring fresh business opportunities for Korean builders and have a positive economic impact on the South Korean economy, which is facing slowing growth rates and falling employment, experts and officials said Thursday.Park is set to embark on her nine-day trip on Sunday. She plans to visit Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, respectively, on her first overseas trip of the year.“The trips are meant to expand the Park Geun-hye government’s diplomatic landscape out to the Middle East region and to strengthen ties with Gulf nations this year, which marks the 50th anniversary of (South Korean builders’) entry to foreign markets,” said Ju Chul-ki, senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs.\\xa0This May 20, 2014, photo shows President Park Geun-hye and Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan (seventh from left), deputy prime minister of United Arab Emirates, attending an installation ceremony of a Korean-made nuclear reactor in Barakah in the Gulf nation. (Cheong Wa Dae)The South Korean government will also seek to diversify business portfolios with Gulf nations to prepare for the post-oil era, shifting their focus from heavy industries of energy and plants to high-value-added industries such as education, medical services and infrastructure improvement.“We will link their policies aimed at diversifying industry (portfolios) with our three-year economic plans,” Ju said.Park plans to introduce her vision of creative economy aimed at nurturing creative ideas from across society, and assimilating them with ICT, science and technology, and other industries.Park’s Middle East trip was previously scheduled for last year, but was put on hold after she came under fierce public scrutiny over the government’s bungled response to the sinking of a ferry that killed 300 in April. Park visited the UAE on a two-day trip instead, on the request of the Middle Eastern country. She attended a ceremony to mark the installation of the first nuclear reactor developed and exported by Korean firms to the country. “It is a must for South Korean presidents to visit (traditional partners) in the Middle East to maintain strategic and economic ties on a regular basis rather than exploring ways to break into new markets in the region,” said In Nam-sik, an associate professor of European and African studies at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security, referring to the South Korean economy’s heavy economic dependence on the oil-rich nations.The four nations are South Korea’s major destinations for construction and plant exports as well as major providers of fossil fuel energy. Trade volume between South Korea and the four countries accounts for 74 percent of total trade in the Middle East region, according to the presidential office.Earlier this week, Park urged officials to expand economic cooperation with the region, stressing that massive construction and infrastructure projects in oil-rich nations could become a new growth engine for South Korea’s economy.The president said she expected Korean builders to seize opportunities to initiate “the second Middle East boom.” In the 1970s, South Korea sent tens of thousands of engineers and workers to the Middle East during a construction boom in the region.This year marks the 50th year since South Korean builders entered foreign markets, and the 40th year since they set foot in the Middle East.Her tour of the four nations comes at a critical time, with Korean builders suffering from declining orders from the Middle East. With international crude prices falling, oil-rich Gulf nations are expected to cut the number of construction orders this year as profits from oil exports deteriorate. According to a study by Hyundai Research Institute, Korean builders are forecast to lose $6.8 billion worth of construction orders from foreign countries a year if the price of Dubai crude oil drops 10 percent. The study, quoting a recent forecast by Cambridge Energy Research Associate, said the price of Dubai crude could slide to $64 per barrel this year, a sharp drop from an average price of $100 recorded last year. This implies that Korean builders could lose $24.8 billion or one-third of the total amount of orders they won last year, HRI said. Construction orders from the Middle East totaled 47.5 percent last year.On the first leg of her four-nation trip, Park will visit Kuwait for three days and hold a summit with the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah. The leaders are set to discuss ways to increase bilateral cooperation in energy, construction, railroad, medical and information technology. Park is the first South Korean president to visit the Western-allied Gulf nation in eight years. During her stay, the two sides are also set to announce plans to ease entry of South Koreans to Kuwait, Ju told reporters. Park will also seek Kuwait’s support for peace on the Korean Peninsula and discuss security issues in the Middle East region, he added. Park will then fly to Saudi Arabia on March 4 for a two-day visit to meet newly crowned King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. The two previously met for a summit in Seoul in November. The leaders are to seek expansion of bilateral cooperation in energy, construction, health and communication technology as well as security issues. “Saudi Arabia is one of our core allies that has no diplomatic ties established with North Korea,” said Ju. “We will reconfirm Saudi’s consistent support for South Korea and our policies toward North Korea.” Park also plans to meet Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, chairman of Kingdom Holding Company of Saudi Arabia, popularly known as the Warren Buffet of the Middle East. At her third destination, the UAE, Park plans to meet with Mohammed bin Zayed bin Al Nahyan, prince crown of Abu Dhabi, before heading to Qatar on March 6. It will be their third summit since Park entered office in early 2013. “The UAE has been our strategic partner and we will seek to diversify cooperation in (the) medical, food (and) culture (industries),” the senior presidential secretary said. The Korean government plans to intensify medical cooperation with the UAE to improve the quality of medical service there. Park also plans to meet Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani in return for the Qatari leader’s visit to South Korea in November. Park’s visit is expected to secure more business opportunities for Korean firms in Qatar, the host of the 2022 World Cup.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)']"
